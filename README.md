An Android application that turns your smartphone into a remote control for your fan. This app uses your device's built-in Infrared (IR) blaster to send signals, allowing you to control power, speed, swing, and other functions directly from your phone.

The UI is built with Jetpack Compose, featuring a modern, dark theme for a clean and intuitive user experience.
